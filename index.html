                             Chibuike Johnbosco Kevin Orjioke – An Entrepreneur, self-employed and a researcher. I have researched on the topic factors influencing teachers’ effectiveness in Public Secondary schools in Enugu North L.G.A of Enugu State. To this end three purpose and corresponding research questions were raised to guide the study. The study adopted descriptive survey design and the instrument used to obtain information was structured questionnaire which was validated by three experts; one from Measurement and Evaluation Department and two from Business Education Department both in Enugu State College of Education Technical Enugu. The data collected were analyzed using mean. The population of the study comprised of 779 teachers from the public senior secondary schools in Enugu North Local Government Area of Enugu State. 264 sample size was determined using Random Sampling techniques and Yaro Yamene’s formula where n = N/1+N(e)2. The findings of this study revealed that for both principals and teachers, most of the required facilities and equipment such as electricity, water supply, classrooms, furniture, buildings for staff room, home economics and workshops for Basic technology were not available, in-adequate and not  functional and thus the school facility management was noted as constituting a constraint to teacher effectiveness. School community relations were found to constitute a constraint to teacher effectiveness in public secondary schools in Enugu North Local Government Area of Enugu to a great extent as noted in the following: the principals are not democratic, the PTA’s do not have high opinions of school administration, and cordial relationships between principal, staff and students are absent in Enugu North Local Government Area. The researcher recommended among others that (i) classrooms should be decongested by erecting new buildings in individual schools or establishing more schools in the localities. The present class size which officially stands at thirty five to forty students   per class should be enforced. (ii) Educational authorities should provide special materials for handicapped and gifted children in regular schools. For example, Braille equipment should be made available and special translators employed to translate examinations and tests. (iii) Seminars, workshops and conferences should be organized each term at national, state and local government levels. This will give each teacher the opportunity to attend at least one staff development program a year.
